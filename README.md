Good good study, day day up!

For those who understand this:



"Who Do You Think You Are?"



The race is on to get out of the bottom,

The top is so high so your roots are forgotten,

Giving is good as long as you're getting,

What's driving you is ambition and betting



I said

Who...do you think you are? \(Do you think you are?\)

I said

Who...some kind of superstar,



You have got to



Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are,

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show how good you are!



You're swelling out in the wrong direction

**You've got the bug, superstar you've been bitten,**

Your trumpet's blowing for far too long

Climbing the snake up the ladder, but you're wrong



I said

Who...do you think you are? \(Do you think you are?\)

I said

Who...some kind of superstar,



You have got to!



Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are,

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show how good you are



You have got to reach on up, never lose your soul,

You have got to reach on up, never lose control



I said

Who...do you think you are? \(Do you think you are?\)

I said

Who...some kind of superstar



You have got to!



Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are,

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?

Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
